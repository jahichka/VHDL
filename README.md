# VHDL

Welcome to the VHDL Projects repository! This repository showcases a collection of projects related to VHDL 
(VHSIC Hardware Description Language). Within this repository, you will find projects that cover various aspects of 
digital design and implementation, including optical encoders, RGB LED converters, on-off keying modulators, comparators, 
and signal average value calculators.

#Optical Encoder

The Optical Encoder project focuses on implementing an optical encoder using VHDL. This project involves designing and 
coding a hardware module that converts the optical signal from an encoder into a digital representation. The VHDL code provided 
in this project enables the efficient and accurate conversion of the encoder's optical inputs into corresponding digital outputs.

#RGB LED Converter

The RGB LED Converter project revolves around converting a 24-bit RGB color representation to a 16-bit LED control signal using VHDL. 
This project includes the design and implementation of a VHDL module that takes a 24-bit color value and produces a 16-bit control signal 
suitable for driving an RGB LED. The VHDL code provided in this project enables seamless conversion and control of RGB LED colors.

#On-Off Keying Modulator

The On-Off Keying Modulator project focuses on implementing an On-Off Keying (OOK) modulator using VHDL. This project involves designing
and coding a VHDL module that modulates a digital signal onto a carrier wave using On-Off Keying modulation. The VHDL code provided in this
project enables the generation of OOK modulated signals for various digital input patterns.

#Comparator

The Comparator project revolves around implementing a comparator using VHDL. This project includes the design and implementation of a VHDL 
module that compares two input signals and produces an output signal indicating their relative magnitudes. The VHDL code provided in this project
enables efficient and accurate comparison of digital signals.

#Signal Average Value Calculator

The Signal Average Value Calculator project focuses on implementing a component that calculates the average value of a given signal using VHDL. 
This project involves designing and coding a VHDL module that processes an input signal and produces an output representing the average value. 
The VHDL code provided in this project enables the calculation of signal average values for various input signals.

#Project Structure
The repository is organized into separate folders for each project. Within each project folder, you will find the relevant VHDL source code files, 
along with any additional resources or documentation specific to that project. Feel free to explore the folders and review the code and accompanying 
materials to gain a deeper understanding of the implemented VHDL designs.

Thank you for your interest in the VHDL Projects repository. I hope these projects provide valuable insights into VHDL design and implementation 
and inspire further exploration in the field of digital design.
